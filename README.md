# my-wedding-invitation-card

## Intro
Well, This idea came up when my dad asked me, is this possible to add a specific name in my wedding invitation card, and send out as an e-card to far distance relatives, friends.
I said why not, and here it is.

Basically, the idea is to add the original card (as an image `.png` file) to be the background of a `.svg` file.
Then choosing a font you like on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and adding the text accordingly.
